# AutoArt

An experiment in CLIPS to create an automatic self creation device using the rules that I follow when I make art.

Generally speaking, this is meant to be ran in random mode since, as the name indicates, it should be automatic.  There is, however, a manual mode built in as well for a bit more granular control of the end "product".
